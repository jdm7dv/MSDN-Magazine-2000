<H1>Configuration</H1>

<ol>
<li>Configure Server(s)
<ol type = a>
<li>Run bin\setupserver.cmd.
<li>Deploy the Test Class in TestServer.DLL in MTS (or at least mark it to
support surrogate activation in OLEVIEW.
</ol>
<br>
<li>Configure Client(s)
<ol type = a>
<li>Run bin\setupclient.cmd.
</ol>
<br>
<li>Configure a Routing Server.
<ol type = a>
<li>Run bin\setuproutingserver.cmd.
<li>Edit bin\configroutingserver.reg to specify the desired algorithm.
There are four algorithms provided:
<ul>
<li>LoadBalancingAlgorithms.Random
<li>LoadBalancingAlgorithms.RoundRobin
<li>LoadBalancingAlgorithms.MethodTiming
<li>LoadBalancingAlgorithms.CPULoad
</ul>
<li>Edit bin\configroutingserver.reg to specify a set of servers
(instead of heffalump and northpole), the routing server should NOT be
included on this list.
<li>Run "configroutingserver.reg".
<li>Use the Service Control Panel to configure the LoadBalancer service
to run as a discriminated account which can create objects on the set of
servers.
<li>Run "configclasses.reg" to add the LoadBalancer's AppID to the
registered Test Class.
<li>Copy PDH.DLL to a directory on the path. This DLL is used by the CPU load
algorithm and is needed to load the LoadBalancingAlgorithms DLL. PDH.DLL is
included in the Platform SDK (\mssdk\bin\winnt\pdh.dll).
<li>Start the LoadBalancer service.
</ol>
<br>
<li>Test the system
<ol type = a>
<li>Run TestClient.EXE passing it a number of iterations as a command line argument,
e.g., TestClient 10.
<li>Watch TestClient output.
<li>Watch object count in MTS Explorer on each server.
</ol>
<br>
<li>Troubleshooting
<ol type = a>
<li>Use OLEVIEW on the routing server to test creation of instances of the Test Class on each
of the server machines.
<li>Use OLEVIEW on the routing server to test creation of  an instance of the MethodTiming algorithm,
this should instantiate an instance of the Loader class on each server machine (running in
DLLHOST.EXE).
<li>If the service won't start or object creation fails, make sure service is configured to
run as an account other than System.
